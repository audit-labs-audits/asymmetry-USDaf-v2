The key insight is the flow: when a borrower opens a trove, additional WETH is pulled from them and sent **TO** this contract. This WETH then sits in the `GasPool` until it's either refunded back to the borrower when they close their trove, or paid out to a liquidator as compensation for performing a liquidation.",

Since the `GasPool` is designed specifically to hold funds for these operations and only these two trusted contracts can spend from it, the risks of unlimited approval are mitigated. This method also saves gas by not requiring repeated approval transactions.",

It creates clear separation of concerns, making the gas compensation mechanism easier to understand and audit.

Most importantly, it ensures that gas compensation funds are always available and clearly segregated from user funds, providing both security and predictability to the liquidation incentive system.",
